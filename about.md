**ICS Security Switzerland** is a neutral, non-profit association that brings together engineers, operators, integrators, and assessors dedicated to advancing OT and IACS security beyond individual organizations and commercial interests.

We are a small but motivated group of professionals who believe in collaboration, not competition — and in connecting people who care about industrial cybersecurity in Switzerland.
