We operate as a neutral, non-profit community â€” connecting engineers, operators, integrators, and assessors who care about OT and IACS security beyond company boundaries.

Our purpose is simple: to build a space where Swiss practitioners can **learn, collaborate, and contribute** to advancing standards-based cybersecurity for critical industries.
