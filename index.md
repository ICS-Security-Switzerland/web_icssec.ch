**ICS Security Switzerland** is a newly founded initiative that brings together cybersecurity practitioners and organisations with a shared interest in industrial automation and control systems (IACS/OT) security, standards, and innovation.

We promote awareness, knowledge exchange, and the adoption of the [**ISA/IEC 62443**](https://www.isa.org/standards-and-publications/isa-standards/isa-iec-62443-series-of-standards) standards and related best practices for securing **critical infrastructure** and **industrial sectors** — including energy, water, transportation, and manufacturing.

Members benefit from networking opportunities, educational events, and collaborative projects that drive innovation in IACS security.

## Our Mission

As a community, we aim to:

- Build a strong network among peers across Swiss industries.  
- Foster education and career growth through workshops, talks, and events.  
- Support local companies in aligning with global ISA/IEC standards.  
- Connect Switzerland with the wider ISA Europe and global ISA community.

Join us to stay ahead of emerging security challenges and help shape future standards in Swiss industries.

Membership is open to anyone interested in advancing **operational technology (OT) security** and **industrial automation** in Switzerland.
