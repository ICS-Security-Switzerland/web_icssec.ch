**ICS Security Switzerland** is a newly founded initiative that brings together cybersecurity practitioners and organisations with a shared interest in industrial automation and control systems (IACS/OT) security, standards, and innovation.

We focus on promoting awareness, knowledge exchange, and the adoption of the [**ISA/IEC 62443**](https://www.isa.org/standards-and-publications/isa-standards/isa-iec-62443-series-of-standards) series and related best practices across Swiss industries — including energy, water treatment, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and public transportation.

Members benefit from networking opportunities, educational events, and collaborative projects that drive innovation in IACS security.

## Our Mission

As a community, we aim to:

- Network with peers across Swiss industries.
- Foster education and career growth through workshops, talks and other events.
- Support local companies in aligning with global ISA/IEC standards.
- Connect Switzerland with the broader ISA Europe and global ISA community.

Join us to stay ahead of emerging security challenges and help shape future standards in Swiss industries.

Membership is open to anyone interested in advancing **operational technology (OT) security** and **industrial automation** in Switzerland.
