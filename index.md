**ICS Security Switzerland** is a newly founded initiative that brings together cybersecurity practitioners and organisations with a shared interest in industrial automation and control systems (IACS/OT) security, standards, and innovation.

We promote awareness, knowledge exchange, and the adoption of the [**ISA/IEC 62443**](https://www.isa.org/standards-and-publications/isa-standards/isa-iec-62443-series-of-standards) standards and related best practices for securing **critical infrastructure** and **industrial sectors** — including energy, water, transportation, and manufacturing.

Members benefit from networking opportunities, educational events, and collaborative projects that drive innovation in IACS security.

## Our Mission

As a community, we aim to:

- Build a strong network among peers across Swiss industries.  
- Foster education and career growth through workshops, talks, and events.  
- Support local companies in aligning with global ISA/IEC standards.  
- Connect Switzerland with the wider ISA Europe and global ISA community.

We’re an open community for anyone interested in **operational technology (OT) security** and **industrial automation** in Switzerland. 

If you’re curious about ICS security or just want to meet like-minded people — feel free to join one of our events and see what we’re about.  

💡 *Our primary goal is not to facilitate business or consultancy services.*  
We serve as a **neutral, non-commercial platform** for knowledge exchange and collaboration — a place where professionals can share experiences and best practices in a trusted environment.
